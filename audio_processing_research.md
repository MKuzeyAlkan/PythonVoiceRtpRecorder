# Audio Processing Libraries Research

## Pydub
Pydub is a simple and easy-to-use Python library for audio processing. It supports various audio formats and provides high-level APIs for common tasks like slicing, concatenation, and format conversion.

### Features:
- Supports multiple audio formats (e.g., WAV, MP3, FLAC).
- Easy slicing and concatenation of audio.
- Volume manipulation and effects.
- Export to various formats.

### Pros:
- High-level API simplifies audio processing tasks.
- Active community and good documentation.
- Built-in support for common audio operations.

### Cons:
- Requires external dependencies like FFmpeg or libav for some formats.
- Not suitable for low-level audio manipulation.

### Installation:
```bash
pip install pydub
```

## Wave
The `wave` module is a built-in Python library for reading and writing WAV files. It provides low-level access to WAV file data.

### Features:
- Read and write WAV files.
- Access audio parameters (e.g., channels, sample width, frame rate).
- Low-level control over audio data.

### Pros:
- No external dependencies (built into Python).
- Lightweight and efficient for WAV file handling.
- Suitable for low-level audio manipulation.

### Cons:
- Limited to WAV format.
- No high-level features like slicing or effects.

### Usage Example:
```python
import wave

# Open a WAV file
with wave.open('example.wav', 'rb') as wav_file:
    params = wav_file.getparams()
    frames = wav_file.readframes(params.nframes)
```

## Recommendation
For this project:
- Use **Pydub** for high-level audio processing tasks like slicing and exporting.
- Use **Wave** for low-level manipulation of WAV files, especially when working directly with audio payloads from RTP packets.
